-- üß© Module 2: Filtering & Searching in SQL
-- üîç Core Concepts:
-- Concept	Purpose
-- WHERE	Apply conditions
-- AND / OR	Combine multiple conditions
-- IN	Match value from a list
-- BETWEEN	Match a range (inclusive)
-- LIKE	Match partial patterns (wildcards)
-- IS NULL / IS NOT NULL	Check for NULL values
-- NOT	Negate any condition

‚úÖ Module 2: SQL WHERE Clause ‚Äì Cheat Sheet
Concept	Syntax	Example

Basic WHERE	SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = value;	SELECT * FROM students WHERE city = 'Delhi';

NOT Equal	!= or <>	SELECT * FROM students WHERE course != 'Java';

IN Clause	column IN (val1, val2, ...)	SELECT * FROM students WHERE city IN ('Delhi', 'Mumbai');

NOT IN Clause	column NOT IN (val1, val2, ...)	SELECT * FROM students WHERE course NOT IN ('Java', 'Python');

BETWEEN	column BETWEEN low AND high	SELECT * FROM students WHERE age BETWEEN 20 AND 25;

NOT BETWEEN	column NOT BETWEEN low AND high	SELECT * FROM students WHERE age NOT BETWEEN 20 AND 25;

LIKE (Starts)	column LIKE 'A%'	SELECT * FROM students WHERE name LIKE 'A%';

LIKE (Ends)	column LIKE '%a'	SELECT * FROM students WHERE name LIKE '%a';

LIKE (Contains)	column LIKE '%n%'	SELECT * FROM students WHERE name LIKE '%n%';

LIKE (Exact Length)	LIKE '____'	SELECT * FROM students WHERE name LIKE '____';

IS NULL	column IS NULL	SELECT * FROM students WHERE mobileNum IS NULL;

IS NOT NULL	column IS NOT NULL	SELECT * FROM students WHERE course IS NOT NULL;

AND Condition	cond1 AND cond2	SELECT * FROM students WHERE city='Delhi' AND course='Java';

OR Condition	cond1 OR cond2	SELECT * FROM students WHERE age<20 OR gender='female';

NOT	NOT condition	SELECT * FROM students WHERE NOT city='Delhi';

Combine Conditions	(cond1 AND cond2) OR cond3	SELECT * FROM students WHERE (age > 21 AND gender='male') OR city='Mumbai';
